## Question 4

In the 2-D world of Flatland, the Circles were having their sports day and wanted to end it with a nice formation. So, they called upon Mr. Sphere from Spaceland for help. Mr Sphere decides to arrange the Circles in square formations. He starts with N Circles and forms the largest possible square using these Circles. He then takes the remaining Circles and repeats the procedure. A square of side S requires S2 Circles to create.

Find the number of squares he will be able to form at the end of the process.

## Input:
- First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single integer N.
## Output:
- For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of squares.

## Constraints
- 1≤T≤1000
- 1≤N≤1000
## Sample Input:
- 2
- 85
- 114

## Sample Output:
- 2
- 4
