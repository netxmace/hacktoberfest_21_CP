## Question 11
Shaheen has an array A consisting of positive integers. This array is sorted in non-decreasing order from left to right.
You are given Q queries. Each query consists of three integers l, r, x. Answer of this query can be found as follows. 
Consider the sub array al, al+1… ar. 
The answer to the query is the count of numbers in this sub array that are greater or equal to x.

## Input
* The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n, Q.
* The second line contains n space separated integers denoting the array A.
* Each of the next Q lines contains three space-separated integers l, r, x denoting the query.
## Output
Output Q lines one for each query containing the answer for the corresponding the query.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n,Q ≤ 10^5 
- 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
- 1≤ l ≤ r ≤n
- 1 ≤x ≤ 10^9
## Sample Input
- 5 6
- 1 2 3 6 9
- 1 5 1
- 1 5 3
- 1 5 10
- 1 4 4
- 2 5 4
- 2 5 1

## Sample Output
- 5
- 3
- 0
- 1
- 2
- 4


## Explanation
- For the first query, all the elements of the array are ≥1. Thus, the answer is 5.
- For the second query, the answer will be 3, as the elements 3, 6, 9 are ≥3.
